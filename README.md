## Learn Redux!

This project was built for learning purposes
<br />
Feel free to send a PR incase you would like to contribute to this tutorial

This repo has a Final and Starter branch, both including a walkthrough through informative comments
<br />
    Final includes an indepth overview, while Starter walks you through writing out Redux

My suggested flow to follow in order to understand how redux work is the following files in this order...

## FINAL BRANCH FLOW
<br />
Use this branch for an in-depth overview. Check starter branch for a step-by-step walkthrough
<br />

1.) src/index
<br />
2.) src/components/App
<br />
3.) src/components/SongList
<br />
4.) src/actions/index
<br />
5.) src/reducers/index



A simple overview of redux could be understated to:
<br />
    - initializing a redux store
    <br />
    - creating store reducers which compartamentalize information
    <br />
    - passing store to parent component so it and all children can access/manipulate the stores data or "state"
