## Learn Redux!

This project was built for learning purposes
Feel free to send a PR incase you would like to contribute to this tutorial

This repo has a Final and Starter branch, both including informative comments
    Final includes an indepth overview, while Starter walks you through writing out Redux

My suggested flow to follow in order to understand how redux work is the following files in this order...

1.) src/index
2.) src/components/App
3.) src/components/SongList
4.) src/actions/index
5.) src/reducers/index



A simple overview of redux could be understated to:
    initializing a redux store
    creating store reducers which compartamentalize information
    passing store to parent component so it and all children can access/manipulate
        the stores data or "state"
